# PyTorch Snippets
## Pytorch Hooks [001]
PyTorch Hooks play a pivotal role within PyTorch, offering a flexible mechanism to examine and control intermediate activations or gradients in neural network layers during both forward and backward passes. Within this repository, you'll find a simple toy example that I created to delve deeper into forward hooks, which I extensively utilized during my master's thesis.

# Pytorch Hooks
PyTorch Hooks play a pivotal role within PyTorch, offering a flexible mechanism to examine and control intermediate activations or gradients in neural network layers during both forward and backward passes. Within this repository, you'll find a simple toy example that I created to delve deeper into forward hooks, which I extensively utilized during my master's thesis.

Expect updates to this repository in the near future, where I plan to provide a more comprehensive explanation and include additional information for a more thorough understanding.
